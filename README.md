# Loan-Defaulter-Prediction
Datasets Context:
Here we have a dataset of customers with individual's details of their financial and living status that have or have not defaulted the loan from the bank.
Analysis Goal:
Looking into the customer status what are the correlation on defaulting the loan
Creating a prediction model based on the customer status, whether the person will default the loan or not
Audience:
Providing insights to banks on what are the major influences of defaulting the load.
The idea of this analysis is to help bank to make better decision making when authorizing loans and evaluating risk level using the predictive model.
Tools and Libraries:
Descriptive analysis will be used to examine the correlation between target variables and independents variable , using numpy and pandas and seaborn for data visualisation and make conclusions
Classification analysis will be used to make the predictive model using Xgboost model
